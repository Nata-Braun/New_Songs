So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothin' else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothin' else matters

Never cared for what they do
They never cared for what they know
'Cause I know
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothin' else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
