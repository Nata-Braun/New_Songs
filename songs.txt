So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothin' else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothin' else matters

Never cared for what they do
They never cared for what they know
'Cause I know
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothin' else matters
